# CIF API 0.3.0 (public release)

The CIF API provides a standard C interface for reading, writing, and
manipulating Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs).  It is targeted
in particular at CIF 2.0, but it provides support for CIF 1.1 and earlier
as well.

HTML documentation is available online at http://comcifs.github.io/cif_api/

The package includes several example programs to demonstrate the API's usage;
see `src/examples/`.  These may optionally be built (and installed) with the
API library.  One of them is a text-mode CIF 2.0 file syntax checker, which
might be of some interest.  Also, the tests (`src/tests/`) collectively provide
a fairly comprehensive demonstration of the API's features, though their
primary purpose is to verify that the library works as intended.

Refer to file INSTALL for general installation instructions.  Build details
specific to this package follow:

 * The package depends on the International Components for Unicode (ICU), so
  its headers and development libraries are required to build the CIF API
  library and tests.  At least the ICU development libraries will be required
  to build programs that use the CIF API library.  The CIF API was developed
  and tested against ICU 4.2, and it is expected to be compatible also with
  subsequent versions and some earlier versions (at least back to v3.6, which
  was used in early development).  In particular, it has been successfully
  built and tested against version 55-1.

 * The package depends on SQLite for its CIF storage engine.  It was developed
  and tested against SQLite 3.6.20, and is expected to work with many later
  versions.  It depends on foreign key support, which was introduced in
  version 3.6.19, so versions earlier than that are not supported.

 * Configuring the project for building requires the `pkg-config` program and
  pkg-config data for ICU.

 * The reference C compiler employed for package development was GNU gcc 4.4.7.
  Considerable effort was devoted, however, to restricting implementation code
  to the intersection of standard C90 and standard C99, and additionally to
  avoiding code that has different meaning in C and C++.  With very few
  caveats, any compiler that is compliant with any one of C90, C99, C2011,
  C++98, or C++2011 should be able to build the project.

 * At present, the `--enable-extra-warnings` configuration option is effective
  only for gcc.

 * There are a few other project-specific configuration options, but
  they are adequately explained in `configure`'s help text.

The package has been built and tested successfully on Linux (CentOS 6, Debian);
this is the primary development platform), on OS X 10.8, and on Windows 7.
For OS X builds, the needed dependencies are readily available via the "Fink"
package management system and its public repositories, among other means.
For Windows, the dependencies are available via the MinGW-w64 project, and
further information is provided in file README_Windows.  Those approaches
assume you want to use the provided package build system; other approaches
may be available if you want to build the project with a different toolchain,
such as Visual Studio on Windows or XCode on OS X.  The project has few,
if any, toolchain dependencies, but only limited support is available for
such build strategies.

The International Union of Crystallography holds a patent on the STAR
file format, which is parent to CIF, and it is likely that the CIF API
implementation provided herein practices that patent.  No license 
to do so accompanies or is associated with this package itself, but the
IUCr extends broad and liberal permission, as described in its policy on
its CIF and STAR intellectual property: http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/ipr.html.
The CIF API author holds no other rights to practice the patent, but to the
best of his knowledge, the CIF API implementation satisfies the IUCr's
terms for licensure.
