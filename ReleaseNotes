CIF API 0.3.0 Release Notes
---------------------------

Version 0.3.0 of the CIF API is a production release.  Significant changes
relative to the previous release (0.2.0) include:

 - Type names have been changed.
   The implementation had adopted the convention of assigning type names ending
   in suffix '_t', but all such names are reserved by POSIX.  These names
   were changed by appending a 'p', so that the suffix is now '_tp'.  This
   does not affect binary compatibility, but it does affect source
   compatibility.
