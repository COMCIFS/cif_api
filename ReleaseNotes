            significant figures are rounded away.
 - Bug fix: the parser accepted "_" as a data name
 - Added an RPM spec file to the distribution
 - Added pkg-config support
 - Modified SQLite usage for significant memory savings and a slight performance
   gain.
 - Several bug fixes in cif_analyze_string()
 - Fixed a serious bug in cif_linguist involving loop header output


CIF_API 0.4.1 Release Notes
---------------------------

Version 0.4.1 of the CIF API is a maintenance release, principally addressing
bugs and improving performance of the core CIF API library and its accompanying
example programs and tools.  Notable changes include:

 - Bug fix: the numeric formatter incorrectly handled the case where all
            significant figures are rounded away.
 - Bug fix: a lone underscore (_) was generally accepted as a valid data name


CIF_API 0.4.0 Release Notes
---------------------------

Version 0.4.0 of the CIF API is a production release.  Significant changes
relative to the previous release (0.3.0) include:

 - Added experimental program cif_linguist.
 - Modified char vs. numb handling in the parser
 - Added the 'quoted' attribute to data values, and implicit and explicit
   conversions between quoted and unquoted forms.
 - Refactored to provide public utility function cif_analyze_string()


CIF API 0.3.0 Release Notes
---------------------------

Version 0.3.0 of the CIF API is a production release.  Significant changes
relative to the previous release (0.2.0) include:

 - Type names have been changed.
   The implementation had adopted the convention of assigning type names ending
   in suffix '_t', but all such names are reserved by POSIX.  These names
   were changed by appending a 'p', so that the suffix is now '_tp'.  This
   does not affect binary compatibility, but it does affect source
   compatibility.
 - Parse options were added to enable parsing ancient CIFs that use vertical
   tabs as inline whitespace and/or form feeds as line terminators.
 - Added function cif_get_api_version(), which does what its name suggests.
 - Fixed several minor bugs and portability issues observed in the beta-only
   release 0.2.0.
