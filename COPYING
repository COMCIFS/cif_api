NOTE: The International Union of Crystallography holds a patent on the STAR
file format, which is parent to CIF, and it is likely that the CIF API
implementation practices that patent.  Nothing in this license conveys any
rights to do so, but the IUCr itself extends broad and liberal permission,
as described in its policy on its CIF and STAR intellectual property:
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/ipr.html.  To the best of its author's knowledge,
the CIF API implementation provided herein satisfies the IUCr's terms for
licensure to practice the STAR patent.

This software and documentation comes with NO WARRANTY, neither express nor
implied, not even a warranty of fitness for any particular purpose.  Use only
