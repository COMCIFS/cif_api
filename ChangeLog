CIF API Change Log

Version 0.4.3
* Updated the RPM spec
  Updated ICU pkgconfig dependencies in the RPM spec file.

Version 0.4.2
* Added a pkg-config description
  Added a template for a pkg-config .pc file describing libcif.  It is filled
  by the configure script and the resulting .pc file is installed by 'make
  install'.
* Added an RPM spec file
  Added a spec file for building and installing the CIF API software via RPM.
  Both a 'configure' template for the spec file and a copy of the spec file
  itself are included in the misc/ subdirectory.
* SQLite usage improvements
  Switched from a default UTF-16 database to default UTF-8 for considerable
  space savings and (surprisingly) approximately 2% faster performance.
* Unit tests and bug fixes for cif_analyze_string()
  Implemented unit tests for function cif_analyze_string(), and fixed several
  bugs that they revealed.  (Issues number 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.)
* Fixed a bug in cif_linguist's handling of loop headers
  Fixed a flaw in cif_linguist in which it failed to output loop headers
  correctly (issue 9).
* Fixed a regression in the parser's recovery behavior for invalid values
  The addition in v0.4.0 of a persistent distinction between quoted and
  unquoted values caused a regression in the parser's behavior when it
  encounters an unquoted value of a form that CIF does not permit.  That
  bug is fixed, restoring the parser's error recovery behavior of accepting
  the value.  Such values are marked as if they had been parsed quoted.
* Made cif_linguist preserve whitespace and comments
  In a substantial revision to cif_linguist, supported by small changes to the
  parser's usage of whitespace callbacks, made cif_linguist preserve
  whitespace abd comments when it translates a file.
* Fixed a build system bug related to finding ICU
  The 'configure' program failed to determine the correct build options for
  ICU support in the event that the ICU headers were not available in the
  default include path (even though it correctly determined where to find
  them).  The problem is resolved in this version.

Version 0.4.1
* Added '-f' fast mode option to cif2_syncheck
  If the -f option is passed to cif2_syncheck then it runs the parser in
  syntax-only mode, with no data-handling callbacks.  This turns out to be
  about 200 times faster (literally), but does not detect duplicate data
  names, frame codes, or block codes.  This option was motivated by the
  example parser provided with cctbx::ucif, which operates exactly the
  same way.
* Added support for SQLite memory-based mode
  Added code protected by conditional-compilation directives to cif.c.  When
  enabled, CIF storage will be handled by SQLite in-memory databases instead
  of SQLite temporary databases.  Enabling this mode provides a parse-speed
  advantage advantage on the order of 35%, but removes automatic spillover
  to the file system.  The CIF API's SQLite form of CIF data is many times
  larger than CIF's native text form, so spillover can be very important.
  The build system intentionally provides no direct support for enabling
  in-memory mode.

Version 0.4.0
* Added CIF 1.1-format output
  Previously, the CIF API could read either CIF 1.1 format or CIF 2.0 format,
  but on the output side, it could write only CIF 2.0 format.  A write option
  has been defined (the first one, though the framework for it already
  existed) to enable users to select CIF 1.1 output.
* Switched to preferring line folding for text-field escaping
  When the trimmed first line of a text field ends with a backslash in
  CIF 2.0 output mode, or when the trimmed first line consists of a single
  backslash in CIF 1.1 mode, the text-field value must somehow be escaped to
  prevent readers from interpreting the field as being prefixed and / or
  folded.  Prefixing was previously used for that purpose, but to better
  support CIF 1.1, line folding is now used instead.  (Prefixing is performed
  only if the field value contains a newline / semicolon digraph.)
* Text-field output fixes
  Fixed at least two bugs in the text-field output routine, which now has more
  prominence.  (1) Previously, completely empty lines were filtered out of
  text-field values when line-folding or text prefixing was in effect; they
  are now preserved.  (2) Line-folding was not performed correctly for lines
  that (after trimming) ended with a backslash; correct folding is now
  implemented.
* Added automatic char-to-numb coercion
  Updated cif_value_get_number() and cif_value_get_su() to automatically
  convert the provided value object to numeric kind if it is initially of
  character kind and such a coercion is possible.  Changed the parser to
  avoid distinguishing NUMB values from CHAR values at parse time, relying
  instead on coercing values as needed, later.
* Added a value property tracking quoted status
  Longstanding CIF conventions establish that the interpretation of a data
  value can depend on whether it is presented whitespace-delimited or in one
  of the other forms.  They contain some specific examples of how that
  distinction is conventionally used, but nothing restricts the distinction to
  those cases.  The CIF API now provides a modifiable value property that
  designates whether a value is consider 'quoted' or not, provides additional
  coercions around some changes to that attribute's value, and where possible,
  honors that attribute on output.
* Added EXPERIMENTAL program cif_linguist
  Added CIF format translation program cif_linguist to the distribution.
  It is only lightly tested, and it has several notable limitations, such
  as stripping all CIF comments in the course of translation.
* Added public functions and header
  Added new public functions cif_analyze_string() and
  cif_is_reserved_string().  These are used internally for making decisions
  about value coercion and formatting, but they are also made accessible for
  library users.  Added new public header cif_error.h declaring global
  variables provided by the CIF API library that contain
  programmatically-accessible text explaining each CIF error code.

Version 0.3.0
* Changed type names
  Because POSIX reserves type names ending in _t, the names of all types
  provided by the CIF API have been changed to use suffix _tp instead.
* Provisions for recent ICU
  Versions of ICU more recent than the one against which the library was
  initially developed incorporate a change that causes a host of
  const-correctness warnings to be emitted during compilation, mostly from the
  tests.  These issues were resolved with respect to ICU 55-1 (and the code is
  still fine with respect to ICU 4.2.1).
* Building on Win32 / Win64
  Updated for building as a native DLL on Windows (Win32 / Win64).  The
  MinGW-w64 toolchain was specifically targeted, but overall the changes were
  few, and the code is overall very portable, so it is likely that the result
  could be adapted for other Windows toolchains with comparative ease.
* Bulding on OS X
  Not much was really needed to provide for building on OS X, but a small
  build system change cleaned up an issue encountered when relying on Fink for
  dependencies.
* Support for non-standard whitespace and EOL
  Added parser options enabling it to recognize some program-specified
  additional characters as having significance as CIF whitespace or
  end-of-line.  Aimed mainly at early CIFs that use vertical tabs and / or
  form feeds for whitespace and end-of-line purposes, respectively, this
  feature is in fact a bit more general than that.
* Added function cif_get_api_version()
  Added an API function cif_get_api_version() to enable client applications
  to determine which version of the API they are accessing.

Version 0.2.0.3
* Bug in cif_loop_add_item()
  Fixed a bug in which cif_loop_add_item() did not correctly handle a NULL
  default value.
* Documentation of packet iterator effects
  Documentation of the possible negative effects and constraints of open
  packet iterators was added to the general packet iterator description and
  to the docs of cif_loop_get_packets().
* Fixed a narrow text-folding failure case
  The text block line-folding code used by cif_write() could produce invalid
  output because it failed to protect against lines being folded immediately
  before a semicolon (only a problem when not also prefixing).  That issue is
  now resolved.

Version 0.2.0.2
* Issues with ssize_t
  Fixed a header declaration and build configuration issue resulting in
  declarations of type ssize_t not being visible in some places where it is
  used.  Observed on Debian.
* ICU pkg-config package names
  Fixed a build configuration issue arising on Debian, where the pkg-config
  data for ICU are split among multiple logical packages.
* Tests performing exact floating-point comparisons
  Fixed a test implementation issue revolving around exact FP comparisons
  being performed in certain places where approximate comparisons were needed.
  (The tests still use exact comparison where exact agreement is expected.)
* Long time to handle many-packet loops
  Fixed a performance issue associated with adding packets to loops already
  having many packets.
* Minor reorganization
  Merged macros for Unicode code point constants used in different source
  files into a common location (src/internal/values.h).  Added consistent
  source comments to the internal headers indicating that they are not
  intended to be installed.  Changed the scope of one 'extern "C"' block.
  Added a few source comments.
* Added CIF_MEMORY_ERROR
  Added error code CIF_MEMORY_ERROR, and updated substantially all functions
  that perform dynamic memory allocation to raise that error code in the
  event of a memory allocation failure.
* Removed the build dependency on a line-counting command
  Updated the build system -- in particular, the part that generates a header
  file from the database schema -- to remove the need to count lines.  The
  generated header is slightly different, and the code that uses it is
  adjusted to match.

Version 0.2.0.1
* C++ compatibility in cif_cstr_to_ustr()
  Fixed a C++ compatibility issue in cif_cstr_to_ustr()
* Configure script bug
  Fixed an error in the configuration program, related to the
  --enable-c89-enforcement option

Version 0.2.0
* Initial full (beta test) release


Known Issues
* The SQLite back end is slow-ish.
  So far this performance issue is exhibited most clearly by parsing large
  (hundreds of kB) CIFs.  Profiling shows virtually all runtime being consumed
  by SQLite.
