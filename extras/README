Extra CIF-related Files

cif_parser.y
------------
This file provides a CIF 2.0 grammar suitable for use with the GNU Bison parser generator.  It does rely on a few
bison-specific features -- notably, to produce a reentrant parser -- but it should be relatively easy to adapt it to
any other YACC-inspired parser generator.  The generated parser defines no error recovery strategy and no semantic
actions, and it does not test name uniqueness, loop packet completeness, or line-length limits; it is intended
primarily for illustrative and demonstration purposes.


cif_scanner.l
-------------
This file provides the definition of a CIF 2.0 lexical analyzer complementing the grammar in cif_parser.y.  It must
be processed with the Flex scanner generator, as it uses flex-specific features -- notably, to produce a reentrant
scanner.  It might be possible to modify it for use with traditional 'lex' or other lex-like scanner generators.  The
generated scanner does not assign semantic values to tokens, so in its current form it serves only illustrative and
demonstration purposes.


The scanner and parser have been only lightly tested.  They are specific to CIF 2.0, and would require modifications
(mostly to the scanner) to properly handle other versions of CIF.
