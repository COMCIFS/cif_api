/**
 * @page resource_mgmt Resource management with CIF API
 *
 * The core CIF API, being written in C, leaves basic responsibility for resource management in the hands of the
 * application programmer.  Nevertheless, the API is designed to make the resource
 * management burden as light as reasonably possible.  What follows is a discussion of many of the considerations
 * and specific API features that relate to resource management.
 *
 * @section basics Resource management basics
 * For the most part, CIF API objects are created dynamically via functions having @c _create in their names
 * (@c cif_create_block(), for example).  Each object type for which there is a creation function has one or more
 * functions for releasing that object and all its internal state:
 * @li Most types have a @c cif_*_free() function that cleans up objects of that type.  These are the
 *         workhorse resource releasing functions.  For objects that are handles on parts of a managed CIF, these
 *         functions release the handle without modifying the underlying managed CIF.
 * @li Most handle objects have a @c cif_*_destroy() function that removes the portion of the managed CIF represented
 *         by the handle.  Inasmuch as the handle would be useless after such an operation is performed, these
 *         functions also clean up the handle object as if by calling the appropriate free function.
 *
 * Use of the type-specific resource release functions ensures that all internal state is correctly released.
 * Application code must not pass CIF API objects to the C library's @c free() function, except as may be explicitly
 * described elsewhere in the API documentation.
 * 
 * Except where otherwise specified, CIF API functions that return a pointer to the caller via a pointer pointer
 * (as object creation functions in particular do) thereby assign responsibility for the returned pointer to the
 * calling function.  More generally, any function that allocates an object directly or indirectly bears initial
 * responsibility for releasing that object.  It must ensure the object is released before it returns, or
 * else it must pass responsibility for doing so to another context (typically the caller's).  Note, too, that API
 * functions that accept a pointer pointer argument vary with respect to what they do with the value, if any, that
 * the argument initially points to.  Many of them simply overwrite it, which will result in a memory leak if 
 * the caller passes a pointer to the only pointer to a live object.
 *
 * Except where otherwise specified (such as for the @c cif_*_free() and @c cif_*_destroy() functions), passing a
 * pointer as a CIF API function argument does not transfer responsibility for the pointed-to object to the called
 * function.
 * Furthermore, API functions do not create aliases to their pointer arguments that would make it unsafe for the
 * responsible function to clean them up at its sole discretion.  Where necessary, API functions copy objects in
 * order to avoid creating aliases to them.  These characteristics are intended to minimize confusion about whether
 * application code can or should release any particular CIF API object.
 *
 * Some API functions accept or return general objects such as arrays or Unicode strings.  For the most part, the same
 * rules apply to such objects as to CIF API objects, but the API does not provide resource management functions for
 * such objects.  See specific function documentation for details.  With respect to arrays in particular, consult
 * function docs for information about responsibility for array elements, as distinguished from responsibility for the
 * array itself.
 *
 * It should be borne in mind that CIF API handle objects, such as those of types @c cif_container_tp and
 * @c cif_loop_tp , are separate resources from the corresponding parts of managed CIFs.  At any given time, for any
 * given
 * part of a managed CIF, there may be any number -- including zero -- of extant, valid handles.  New handles can be
 * obtained for existing managed CIF pieces, and handles can be released without affecting the underlying managed CIF.
 * Destroying the underlying managed piece invalidates all outstanding handles, but releases only the handle, if any,
 * by which the destruction was performed.
 *
 * @section special Exceptions and special cases
 * The CIF API provides a handful of functions having resource management relevance that do not fit the general pattern:
 * @li Though it does not have "create" in its name, the cif_parse() function operates as an object creation function
 *         when its last argument is a pointer to NULL.
 * @li The creation function for loop packet iterators is cif_loop_get_packets() .  Its cleanup functions are
 *         cif_pktitr_close() and cif_pktitr_abort() .
 * @li The function cif_value_clean() is unusual in that it releases internal resources held by its argument without
 *         releasing the argument itself (converting it to a kind of value that does not require dynamically-allocated
 *         internal resources).
 * @li There is only one handle object for each overall managed CIF (of type @c cif_tp ).  There is therefore no
 *         function @c cif_free() ; use @c cif_destroy() instead.
 * @li There is no creation function for transparent data type @c cif_handler_tp .

 * @li @c CIF_TRAVERSE_SKIP_CURRENT for the walker to skip traversal of the current element's children, if any, and the current element itself if possible (meaningfully distinct from @c CIF_TRAVERSE_CONTINUE only for the @c *_start callbacks), or
 * @li @c CIF_TRAVERSE_SKIP_SIBLINGS for the walker to skip the current element if possible, its children, and all its siblings that have not yet been traversed, or
 * @li @c CIF_TRAVERSE_END for the walker to stop without traversing any more elements
 *
 * A handler function may, alternatively, return a CIF API error code, which has the effect of CIF_TRAVERSE_END plus
 * additional semantics specific to the traversal function (@c cif_walk() forwards the code to its caller as its

 *
 * @{
 *
 * A packet iterator, obtained via @c cif_loop_get_packets(), represents the current state of a particular iteration
 * of the packets of a particular loop (of a particular container).  Based on that state, the user controls the
 * progression of the iteration and optionally accesses the data and / or modifies the underlying loop.
 *
 * The life cycle of an iterator contains several states:
 * @li @b NEW - The initial state of every iterator.  An iterator remains in this state until it is destroyed via
 *         @c cif_pktitr_close() or @c cif_pktitr_abort(), or it is moved to the @b ITERATED state (or, under special
 *         circumstances, directly to the @b FINISHED state; see below) via @c cif_pktitr_next_packet(); no other
 *         operations are valid for a packet iterator in this state.
 * @li @b ITERATED - The state of an iterator that has a valid previous packet.  An iterator enters this state
 *         via @c cif_pktitr_next_packet() (when that function returns @c CIF_OK), and leaves it via
 *         @c cif_pktitr_remove_packet() [to the @b REMOVED state] or via @c cif_pktitr_next_packet() [to the
 *         @b FINISHED state] when that function returns @c CIF_FINISHED.  All packet iterator functions are valid
 *         for an iterator in this state; some leave it in this state.
 * @li @b REMOVED - The state of an iterator after its most recently iterated packet is removed via
 *         @c cif_pktitr_remove_packet().  From a forward-looking perspective, this state is nearly equivalent
 *         to the @b NEW state; the primary difference is that it is not extraordinary for an iterator to
 *         proceed directly from this state to the @b FINISHED state.
 * @li @b FINISHED - The state of an iterator after @c cif_pktitr_next_packet() returns @c CIF_FINISHED to signal
 *         that no more packets are available.  The only valid operations on such an iterator are to destroy it via
 *         @c cif_pktitr_close() or @c cif_pktitr_abort(), and one of those operations should be performed in a timely
 *         manner.
 *
 * The CIF data model does not accommodate loops without any packets, but the CIF API definition requires such
 * loops to be accommodated in memory, at least transiently.  It is for such packetless loops alone that
 * a packet iterator can proceed directly from @b NEW to @b FINISHED.
 *
 * Inasmuch as CIF loops are only incidentally ordered, the sequence in which loop packets are presented by an iterator
 * is not defined by these specifications.
 *
 * While iteration of a given loop is underway, it is implementation-defined what effect, if any, modifications
 * to that loop other than by the iterator itself (including by a different iterator) have on the iteration results.
 *
 * An open packet iterator potentially places both hard and soft constraints on use of the CIF with which it is
 * associated.  In particular, open iterators may interfere with other accesses to the same underlying data -- even
 * for reading -- and it is undefined how closing or aborting an iterator affects other open iterators.  When multiple
 * iterators must be held open at the same time, it is safest (but not guaranteed safe) to close / abort them in
 * reverse order of their creation.  Additionally, and secondarily to the preceding, packet iterators should be closed
 * or aborted as soon as they cease to be needed.  More specific guidance may be associated with particular API
 * implementations.

 * CIF data values are represented by and to CIF API functions via the opaque data type @c cif_value_tp .  Because this

 * be created via function @c cif_value_create() , and @em independent ones should be released via @c cif_value_free()
 * when they are no longer needed.  Unlike the "handles" on CIF structural components that are used in several other
 * parts of the API, @c cif_value_tp objects are complete data objects, independent from the backing CIF storage
 * mechanism, albeit sometimes parts of larger aggregate value objects.
 *
 * The API classifies values into several distinct "kinds": character (Unicode string) values, apparently-numeric
 * values, list values, table values, unknown-value place holders, and not-applicable/default-value place holders.
 * These alternatives are represented by the enumeration @c cif_kind_tp.  Value kinds are assigned when values are
 * created, but may be changed by re-initialization.  Several functions serve this purpose: @c cif_value_init(), of
 * course, but also @c cif_value_init_char(), @c cif_value_copy_char(), @c cif_value_parse_numb(),
 * @c cif_value_init_numb(), and @c cif_value_autoinit_numb().  If it is unknown, the kind of a value object can be
 * determined via @c cif_value_kind(); this is important, because many of the value manipulation functions are

 * about object ownership.  Such internal copies can still be exposed outside their container objects, however, to
 * reduce copying and facilitate value manipulation.  Value objects that belong to a list or table aggregate are
 * @em dependent on their container object, and must not be directly freed.
 *
 * Table values associate other values with Unicode string keys.  Unlike CIF data values and keywords, table keys are
 * not "case insensitive".  They do, however, take Unicode canonical equivalence into account, thus Unicode strings
 * containing different sequences of characters and yet canonically equivalent to each other can be used
 * interchangeably as table keys.  When keys are enumerated via
 * @c cif_value_get_keys(), the form of the key most recently used to enter a value into the table is the form

 * form to Unicode normalization form NFC.  The result string, if provided, becomes the responsibility of the caller.
 * If not NULL, it is guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.
 *
 * The normalized form output by this function is suitable for comparing CIF "case-insensitive" strings for equivalence,
 * as equivalent strings will have identical normalized forms.  This accounts not only for case folding itself, but also
 * for combining marks, including sequences thereof.  It does not, however, erase distinctions between different Unicode
 * characters that are typically rendered similarly (so-called "compatibility equivalents"), as that would constitute
 * a semantic change.

 * @param[in] srclen the maximum length of the input to normalize; if less than zero then the whole string is
 *     normalized up to the first NUL character (which otherwise does not need to be present); must not exceed
 *     the actual number of UChars in the source string
 * @param[in,out] normalized a pointer to a location to record the result; if NULL then the result is discarded, but
 *     the return code still indicates whether normalization was successful.  If non-NULL, then the pointer at the
 *     specified location is overwritten, and the caller assumes responsibility for freeing the memory to which the
