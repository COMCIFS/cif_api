The SQLite CIF storage engine requires SQLite 3.6.19 or later, compiled
with foreign key and trigger support.  The system will detect whether
suitable support is available in the SQLite library, and fail gracefully
in the event that it is not.

The source is largely compliant with ISO C89, but that it leans slightly
on one implementation-dependent limit. Specifically, it contains one string
literal that exceeds the least length (509 chars) that compliant compilers
are required to support.  As of this writing, that literal is 841 chars
long, and all C89-compliant compilers known to the author in fact support
string literals of that length.  The source also relies on a handful of
common library functions that are not standardized by C89, but are
standardized by C99.  For example, memcpy().
