Intellectual Property Notes
===========================

The CIF API comprises copyrighted property of several people and
organizations, as marked on the files themselves or otherwise recorded
among the CIF API files, including this one.  Where not otherwise
specified, CIF API files belong to John C. Bollinger, Ph.D. of Memphis,
Tennessee, U.S.A..  Specific exceptions include, but are not necessarily
limited to, the contents of the 'uthash' directory; these files are
subject to the copyright statement and license in the file 'LICENSE' in
that directory, and it is subject to those terms that they are distributed
to you.  Additionally, many components of the build system are
parts of, or were generated via, the GNU AutoTools suite.  These contain
code belonging to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and each is marked
with an FSF ownership notice and statements of rights.  The FSF components
are distributed to you under the terms of version 3 of the GNU Public
License (GPL).  A copy of of GPL version 3 is provided in file 'COPYING'.

The International Union of Crystallography holds a patent on the STAR
file format, which is parent to CIF, and it is likely that the CIF API
implementation provided herein practices that patent.  No license 
to do so accompanies or is associated with this package itself, but the
IUCr extends broad and liberal permission, as described in its policy on
its CIF and STAR intellectual property: http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/ipr.html.
The CIF API author holds no other rights to practice the patent, but to the
best of his knowledge, the CIF API implementation satisfies the IUCr's
terms for licensure.

The CIF API is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published
by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

The CIF API is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
