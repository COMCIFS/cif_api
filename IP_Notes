The International Union of Crystallography holds a patent on the STAR
file format, which is parent to CIF, and it is likely that the CIF API
implementation provided herein practices that patent.  No license 
to do so accompanies or is associated with this package itself, but the
IUCr extends broad and liberal permission, as described in its policy on
its CIF and STAR intellectual property: http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/ipr.html.
The CIF API author holds no other rights to practice the patent, but to the
best of his knowledge, the CIF API implementation satisfies the IUCr's
terms for licensure.
