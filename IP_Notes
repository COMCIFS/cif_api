Intellectual Property Notes
===========================

As described in file COPYING, the CIF API source distribution contains code
belonging to multiple parties and subject to multiple licenses.  Additionally,
the implementation probably practices a patent owned by the International Union
of Crystallography.  These notes convey the author's understanding of the
intellectual property factors in play.  Inasmuch as the author is not an
attorney, that understanding may be incomplete and / or inaccurate.

CIF API core software, documentation, examples, and tests
---------------------------------------------------------
The bulk of the source distribution -- including, but not limited to,
everything in the distribution's src/, misc/, dox-html/, and dox-man/
subdirectory trees except 'Makefile.in' files -- is the property of
the CIF API authors.  The license, if any, under which you are permitted
to copy or use these materials is described elsewhere.

GNU Autotools
-------------
The CIF API build system contains code from the GNU Autotools suite, which is
the property of the Free Software Foundation.  The CIF API authors provide it
to you as they are permitted to do under the terms of version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.  You must accept a license from the FSF to make or
transfer a copy of the FSF code, which license can be version 2 of the GPL
or any later version, but you do not require a license to *use* the FSF code.

Although FSF code is involved in *building* the API library and example
programs, no FSF code is incorporated into the built binaries or
documentation, therefore you do not need to license from the FSF for any part
of the library, documentation, or example programs, or anything derived or
built from them.

UTHash
------
The CIF API implementation uses the UTHash C macro package belonging
to Troy D. Hanson.  Its license (in uthash/LICENSE) places mild conditions
on redistributing the source code, with which this distribution complies.
The UTHash license allows unrestricted freedom to distribute and use
binary forms of the UTHash code.

IUCr's STAR patent
------------------
The IUCr's intellectual property policy extends broad rights to practice its
STAR patent, but the policy nevertheless restricts software purporting to
process CIF data. The CIF API implementation does purport to process CIF
data: it purports to read files written to the CIF standard (versions 1.1
and 2.0), and it purports to write files in CIF format (version 2.0).  The
CIF API implementation is distributed to you in the belief that it extracts
data correctly from CIF files and produces CIF 2.0 conformant CIF files,
as required to satisfy the conditions of the patent license.  The CIF API
does not claim to read *definitions* from data dictionaries, notwithstanding
the fact that it will read the CIF data items with which the definitions
in a CIF-format data dictionary are expressed.
